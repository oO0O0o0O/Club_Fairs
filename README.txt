Club Fairs is a personal project I began during the summer of 2020. It is a social network-based club discovery platform, with a design and implementation similar to that of dating apps. I eventually abandoned the project to focus on my studies in cybersecurity, but along the way I gained a tremendous amount of experience in web development. I worked heavily with express.js, react.js, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and any related or required web developed languages and concepts. Much of the functionality was being refurbished and is not available, however the code for the unimplemented features is accessible.
